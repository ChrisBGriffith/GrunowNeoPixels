# GrunowNeoPixels
The Arduino app that controls the vintage Grunow radio cabinet I retrofitted with a Raspberry Pi.

Requires Adafruit's NeoPixel lib as well as the Encoder library. This project is pretty specific to my needs and was my first foray into the world of microcontrollers, but I hope it's helpful to someone anyway.
